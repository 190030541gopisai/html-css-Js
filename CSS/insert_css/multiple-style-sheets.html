		Multiple Style Sheets
		If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

		Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the <h1> element:

		h1 {
		  color: navy;
		}
		Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style for the <h1> element:

		h1 {
		  color: orange;   
		}
		Example
		If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "orange":

		Example
		However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "navy": 

		<head>
		<style>
		h1 {
		  color: orange;
		}
		</style>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
