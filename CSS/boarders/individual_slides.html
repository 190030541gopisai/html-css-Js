				CSS Border - Individual Sides
				From the examples on the previous pages, you have seen that it is possible to specify a different border for each side.

				In CSS, there are also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left):
			*/
			p.one{
				border-top-style:dotted;
				border-right-style:solid;
				border-bottom-style:dashed;
				border-left-style:double;
			}
			/*
				The example above gives the same result as this:
			*/
			p.two{
				border-style:dotted solid dashed double;
			}
				
			/*

				So, here is how it works:

				If the border-style property has four values:

				border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
				top border is dotted
				right border is solid
				bottom border is double
				left border is dashed
				If the border-style property has three values:

				border-style: dotted solid double;
				top border is dotted
				right and left borders are solid
				bottom border is double
				If the border-style property has two values:

				border-style: dotted solid;
				top and bottom borders are dotted
				right and left borders are solid
				If the border-style property has one value:

				border-style: dotted;
				all four borders are dotted
				Example
				/* Four values */
				p {
				  border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
				}

				/* Three values */
				p {
				  border-style: dotted solid double;
				}

				/* Two values */
				p {
				  border-style: dotted solid;
				}

				/* One value */
				p {
				  border-style: dotted;
				}
				
			*/	

			/*
				The border-style property is used in the example above. However, it also works with border-width and border-color.
