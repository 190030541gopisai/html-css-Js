CSS Font Size
Font Size
The font-size property sets the size of the text.

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

Absolute size:

Sets the text to a specified size
Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
Relative size:

Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).

/* Set Font Size With Pixels 

Tip: If you use pixels, you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page.

*/

.font_size>.pixels>h1{
	font-size:40px;
}
.font_size>.pixels>h2{
	font-size:30px;
}
.font_size>.pixels>h3{
	font-size:25px;
}

/* 

Set Font Size With Em
To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.

1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em


In the example above, the text size in em is the same as the previous example in pixels. However, with the em size, it is possible to adjust the text size in all browsers.

Unfortunately, there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer. The text becomes larger than it should when made larger, and smaller than it should when made smaller.


*/

.font_size>.em>h1{
	font-size:2.5em;  /* 40px/16=2.5em */
}
.font_size>.em>h2{
  font-size: 1.875em; /* 30px/16=1.875em */
}
.font_size>.em>h3{
  font-size: 0.875em; /* 14px/16=0.875em */
}

/*

Use a Combination of Percent and Em
The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element:

Example
body {
  font-size: 100%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.875em;
}

p {
  font-size: 0.875em;
}

*/
body{
	font-size:200%;
}
/*

we can see differece that em and px 

em changed according to the body size
whereas 
px not changed because it is fixed to the browser

note:
	it is better to use em insted of px

*/

/*

Responsive Font Size
The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:

Hello World
Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.

*/

.font_size>.viewport_width>h1{
	font-size:10vw;
}
.font_size>.viewport_width>h2{
	font-size:5vw;
}
.font_size>.viewport_width>h3{
	font-size:3vw;
}


/*

note:insted of em we can use viewport width(vw) for responsive ness;

Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.
