What are Web Safe Fonts?
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.

Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name.

Example
Here, there are three font types: Tahoma, Verdana, and sans-serif. The second and third fonts are backups, in case the first one is not found.
