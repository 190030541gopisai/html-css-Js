        Background Cover
        If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

        This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

        Background Stretch
        If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:

        Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element.

        <p>By default, the background image will repeat itself if it is smaller than the element where it is specified, in this case the body element.
