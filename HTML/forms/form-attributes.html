        Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.
        The Action Attribute
        The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

        Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

        In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:
    -->
    <form action="./thanks.html" target="_blank">
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <!--  
        The Target Attribute
        The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

        The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        Value	Description
        _blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
        _self	The response is displayed in the current window
        _parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
        _top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
        framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe
        The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window.

    <!--  
        The Method Attribute
                The Method Attribute
        The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

        The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

        The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

    -->
    <!--  
                Notes on GET:

        Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
        NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
        The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
        Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
        GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
    
        Notes on POST:

        Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
        POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
        Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

    <!--  
        The Autocomplete Attribute
        The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.

        When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

        The Novalidate Attribute
        The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.
