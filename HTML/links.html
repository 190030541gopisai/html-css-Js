                HTML Links - Hyperlinks
        HTML links are hyperlinks.

        You can click on a link and jump to another document.

        When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

        Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
    -->

    <!--  
        HTML Links - Syntax
        The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

        <a href="url">link text</a>
        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

        Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
    -->
    <!--  important
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red
    -->

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">w3schools</a>
    <hr>
    <!-- HTML Links - The target Attribute
        By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

        The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

        The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
    -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">visit w3schools</a>
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
        Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

        A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
    -->
    <a href="papa.jpg" target="_blank">image of girl</a>
    <br>
    <a href="textformatting.html" target="_blank">textformatting.html</a>
    <br>
    <!--  
        HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
        To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:
    -->
    <a href="textformatting.html" target="_blank">
        <img src="papa.jpg" alt="cute girl" height="50%" width="50%">
    </a>
    <br>

    <!-- Link to an Email Address
        Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
    -->
    <a href="mailto:gopisai@gmail.com">mail me</a>
    <br>
    <!-- Button as a Link
        To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

        JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:
    -->
    <button onclick="document.location='textformatting.html'">
            textformatting.html
    </button>
    <hr>
    <!--  
        Link Titles
        The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
    -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"
        title="link for html_links"
        target="_blank"
    >
    w3schools
    </a>
