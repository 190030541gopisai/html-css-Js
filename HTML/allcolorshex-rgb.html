    <!-- An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.

    An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity). 
        rgb(red, green, blue)

    Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.

    This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
    RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

    An RGBA color value is specified with:

    rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

    The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

    <!-- 
        A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

        HEX Color Values
        In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

        #rrggbb

        Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

        For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

        Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.

        To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.

        To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.

        HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

        HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

        HSL Color Values
        In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

        hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

        Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

        Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

        Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.
            
        
        Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.

        100% is pure color, no shades of gray

        50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

        0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.


        Lightness
        The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white).
    
        Shades of Gray
        Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:
        
        HSLA Color Values
        HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

        An HSLA color value is specified with:

        hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

        The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
