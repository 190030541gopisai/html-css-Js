    <!--  
        Block-level Elements
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

        The <div> element is a block-level element.
    -->
    <div style="border:1px solid black;background-color: powderblue;">
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <div style="background-color: greenyellow;">
            <p>this is a paragraph</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--  
        Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

    <address>
    <article>
    <aside>
    <blockquote>
    <canvas>
    <dd>
    <div>
    <dl>
    <dt>
    <fieldset>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <form>
    <h1>-<h6>
    <header>
    <hr>

    <p>
    <pre>
    <section>
    <table>
    <tfoot>
    <ul>
    <video>
    -->


    <!--  
        Inline Elements
        An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.

        This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

    -->
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
    <!--  
        Here are the inline elements in HTML:

        <a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>
    -->

    <!--   important
        Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
    -->
    
    <!--  
        The <div> Element
        The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

        The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

        When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
    -->

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <!--  
        The <span> Element
        The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

        The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
    -->
    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> 
        eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.
    </p>
